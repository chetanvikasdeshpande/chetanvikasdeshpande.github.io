# run this on your computer
# find someone special
> find /-type f -iname "someone special"

# it will tell you target file does not exist
# no need to worry. lets create a new one

> cd /home/.monika/
~/home/monika/$ > someone_special/chetan.cfg

# right now it is empty
# lets fill it with some details
$ curl https://anuroop.com/chetan

# now basic info is ready

# fill it with memories and it'll be ready

# P.S. I'll also make the same code run on my machine with name darkprincess.cfg

# if it doesnt work in first instant  i'll manually install this on your computer when i'll be visiting to solapur ;)

# nothing much of a surprise honestly but i thought since you are busy coding today. i should code something to take your mind off work
